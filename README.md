## Telegram Bot

This is just my starting point using [Telegraf](https://github.com/telegraf/telegraf) for Telegram Bot. The bot can created by contacting the official [BotFather](https://t.me/botfather).

## Installation

Just clone. Everything should be fine :)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pajardevr/telegram-bot
```

Then

```bash
npm install
```

Then, update .env file and the last, serve with node
